Work associated with the algorithms specialization taught
by Tim Roughgarden from Stanford University. Included here is the code for my solutions to 
the programming assignments, written in Python. 

The specialization is composed of four sequential courses, with topics for each detailed briefly below:

### Course 1 - Divide and Conquer, Sorting and Searching, and Randomized Algorithms
Topics:
- Asymptotic analysis of algorithms, including the master method for recursive algorithms
- Sorting and search algorithms: Mergesort, Quicksort, etc.
- Karatsuba integer multiplication
- [Karger's random contractions algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karger%27s_algorithm) for the minimum cut problem

### Course 2 - Graph Search, Shortest Paths, and Data Structures
Topics: 
- Graph search and strongly connected components 
- Min and max heaps, binary search trees, red-black trees.  
- Hash tables and implementations, chaining vs open-addressing, Bloom filters
- [Kosaraju's strongly connect components algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosaraju%27s_algorithm)
- [Dijkstra's shortest paths algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
- 2-heap algorithm for median maintenance
- Hash table based solution to the 2-sum problem

### Course 3 - Greedy Algorithms, Minimum Spanning Trees, and Dynamic Programming
Topics: 
- [Union-find data structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure), with union by rank and path compression enhancements. 
- Huffman trees data structure and application to generating [Huffman codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding)
- Greedy solutions to the job scheduling problem
- [Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm)
- [Krukal's minimum spanning tree algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm)
- k-means clustering using a lazy union-find data structure
- Dynamics programming problems: Sequence alignment, the knapsack problem, minimum weight independent set

### Course 4 - Shortest Paths Revisited, NP-Complete Problems and What To Do About Them
Topics:
- Solutions to the all-pairs-shortest-path problem, including the [Bellman-Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm), [Floyd-Warshall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm), and [Johnson's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnson%27s_algorithm) algorithms
- NP completeness. Approximate and heuristic approaches to NP complete problems.
- Dynamic programming and heuristic solutions to the travelling salesman problem
- Solution to the 2-sat problem through reduction
